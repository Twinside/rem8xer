# 0.8

 - Revisited copy algorithm to handle: referenced instruments and
   tables. We are now following:

     * `INS` command: to switch command (if you use it with `RNL` or other random command...)
     * `NXT` command: spawning another command
     * `TBX` command: external table
     * `EQI` command: override equalizer

   Instrument tables and external tables are now scanned recursively.
